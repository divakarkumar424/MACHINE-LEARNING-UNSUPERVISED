## MACHINE-LEARNING-UNSUPERVISED

This model becomes imperative where there is no target variable to predict. An analysis is based on previously undetected patterns or unknown labels in the dataset, without much human intervention. This model, groups or classifies data points, based on several similarities in the data set, allows certain patterns to evolve upon which the prediction is done
